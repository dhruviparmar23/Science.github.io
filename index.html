	<p>
		Science is a systematic and organized approach to studying the natural world, including its physical, biological, and social aspects, using empirical evidence and logical reasoning. It involves observation, experimentation, and data analysis to develop and test hypotheses and theories about the world around us. Science aims to understand the fundamental principles that govern the universe, and to use this knowledge to make predictions, solve problems, and improve our lives.
